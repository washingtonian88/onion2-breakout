# onion2-breakout
Breakout board for the onion omega 2 with 5V power provided by a micro-USB connector and an interface for connecting a USB device to the Omega2.

This is my first attempt at designing a PCB. I decided to use KiCAD due to mild-familiarity with it and its open nature. The components were chosen to be cheap and easy to obtain (via ebay). Total cost per board is < $10 fully assembled, can be amde cheaper by not populating some of the parts (USB connectors and pin headers).

### ToDo (before ordering):
* ~~Validate foot print for USB interfaces~~
* ~~Make sure the 2.54mm pins are spaced so they will fit on a 'normal' pcb~~
* ~~Consult some guru's on layout / design~~

### ORDERED! 
Bought all of the components on eBay minus the 2.54mm 1x16 pin headers for ~$40 USD to build 10 boards. Here's to hoping for a strong tail wind for the boat. For the first round (Rev. 1) I ordered 3 boards from OSHPark.com (https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/boUh3Ezt) for $16 shipped.
