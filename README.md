Breakout board for the onion omega 2 with 5V power provided by a micro-USB connector and an interface for connecting a USB device to the Omega2.

This is my first attempt at designing a PCB. I decided to use KiCAD due to mild-familiarity with it and its open nature. The components were chosen to be cheap and easy to obtain (via ebay).

### ToDo (before ordering):
* Validate foot print for USB interfaces
* Make sure the 2.54mm pins are spaced so they will fit on a 'normal' pcb
* Consult some guru's on layout / design
